# Angel LaVoie Personal Website

Actual attempt at a personal website for myself.

Mainly through the help of the HTML and CSS template provided by <https://www.w3schools.com> as HTML and CSS are not my forte.

Absolutely wonderful site, would highly recommend checking them out for any programming education.

([Template Used](<https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_dark_portfolio&stacked=h>))

# Info

Site is purely just HTML and CSS, may mess around with some JavaScript elements later on but it wasn't needed so far.
